# Creating an MCP Agent with Pydantic AI: A Complete Guide

Discover how to effortlessly build powerful AI agents using Pydantic AI integrated with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. This ultimate guide walks you through the process of creating your first MCP agent, integrating Milvus vector databases, and setting up practical, scalable vector search workflows.

## Introduction

AI applications today require robust and highly adaptable frameworks that can seamlessly interact with diverse external tools such as vector databases and APIs. Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard facilitating structured communication between AI agents and external services. Coupled with the intuitive, Python-based Pydantic AI framework, MCP sets the stage for developing sophisticated, practical, and scalable agent ecosystems.

This guide is perfect if you're an engineer ready to enhance your AI applications or a developer aiming to master semantic search workflows. You'll learn:

- Essential MCP and Pydantic AI concepts.
- Step-by-step guidance on building your own AI agent.
- Integration of Milvus vector databases via MCP.
- Real-world execution and management tips for your AI agents.

## What are Pydantic AI and MCP?

### Pydantic AI Explained

Pydantic AI streamlines the creation and management of AI agents through its Pythonic, structured approach. It simplifies tasks such as:

- Natural language processing and response structuring.
- Dynamic tool selection based on context.
- Effective integration with external resources via MCP servers.

### Why MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes communication between AI agents and external services, creating seamless interoperability with tools like Milvus, FAISS, web search APIs, and more.

Benefits of MCP:
- Uniform interfaces across various tools.
- Modular design enhancing scalability.
- Improved security and observability.

## Building Your MCP Agent: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Begin by installing the essential libraries:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai mcp-server-fetch postgres-mcp pymilvus
```

Initialize your AI backend (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet):

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet')
```

Verify your setup by testing a basic agent function:

```python
async def chat_interface(user_input):
    result = await agent.run(user_input)
    return result.data
```

### Step 2: Integrating MCP Servers

Use FastMCP to connect your agent with Milvus for advanced semantic searches:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pymilvus import connections, Collection

connections.connect(host='localhost', port='19530')
collection = Collection("docs_collection")

server = FastMCP('VectorSearchServer')

@server.tool()
async def semantic_search(query: str, top_k: int = 5):
    query_embedding = embed_text(query)
    results = collection.search(
        data=[query_embedding],
        anns_field="embedding",
        param={"metric_type": "IP", "params": {"nprobe": 10}},
        limit=top_k,
        output_fields=["source", "timestamp"]
    )
    return results

agent.mcp_servers = [server]
```

### Step 3: Configuring and Running Multiple MCP Servers

Manage multiple MCP servers dynamically using JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {"name": "MilvusSearch", "command": "uv run milvus_mcp.py", "tools": ["semantic_search"]},
    {"name": "WebSearch", "command": "python -m mcp_server_fetch"}
  ]
}
```

## How to Run and Use Your MCP Agent

### 1. Starting MCP Servers

Run each server from separate terminal windows or scripts:

```bash
uv run milvus_mcp.py
```

Alternatively, automate server launches:

```bash
python launch_servers.py
```

Ensure external dependencies like Milvus are active.

### 2. Running Your Agent

Interact with your agent easily:

```python
import asyncio
from your_agent_module import agent

async def main():
    user_input = "Find documents related to autonomous AI agents"
    response = await agent.run(user_input)
    print(response.data)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Troubleshooting Checklist

- Confirm Milvus connections and schemas.
- Log MCP server outputs for debugging.
- Use error handling for smoother troubleshooting.

## Advanced Considerations for Scaling

- **Security:** Implement RBAC within MCP for secure interactions.
- **Performance:** Optimize batching to enhance throughput and reduce latency.
- **Observability:** Deploy MCP monitoring services like Logfire for real-time insights.

## Next-Level MCP Features

- **Hybrid Searches:** Merge semantic and keyword search results seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Tool Loading:** Update MCP tools live without service interruption.
- **Multi-Model Routing:** Assign tasks dynamically to specialized AI models.
